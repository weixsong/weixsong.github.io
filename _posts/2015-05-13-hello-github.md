It seems more and more people are porting their blogs to Github, so I spend some time to familiar with Jekyll, Bootstrap, YAML Markdown and something, then I wrote my first blog on Github by YAML Markdown.

## Self-Introduction

I'm a programmer in China, have only one year work experience.

Currently I'm working in Oracle, I like this company.

I'm doing search related work, and also do some topic modelling such as LDA model, I'm interested in NLP, ML, topic model and so on.

The programming languages that I use are **java**, **python**, **javascript**, **c/c++**.
